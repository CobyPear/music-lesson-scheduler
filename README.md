This app is intended to be used as an easy solution to scheduling new students for music lessons.


### Technologies Used

- React
- Express
- Node
- MongoDB
- Jest
    - supertest
    - @shelf/jest-mongodb

Started with Bulma on the frontend, but I didn't like how it masked a tags as buttons, so I switched to Material UI.
#### Tests

I'm using this project as an opportunity to strengthen my skills with TDD. Since this project, I have only briefly worked with tests.

I am utilizing the Jest testing framework along with @shelf/jest-mongodb preset, which uses mongo-memory-store, and supertest library.
